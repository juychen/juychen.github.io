# Nextflow

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/about-us.html) is free open source software distributed under the Apache 2.0 licence developed by Seqera Labs. The software is used by scientists and engineers to write, deploy and share data-intensive, highly scalable, workflows on any infrastructure.

It help us to define workflows to run a pipeline composed of multiple programmes. The reason we appply Nextflow is that it can be applied to workflows in the containers or on a clould computing platform.

You can refer to the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) for more information about nextflow syntax and usage.
